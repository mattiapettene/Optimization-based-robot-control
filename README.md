# Optimization-based robot control projects

## First assignment (TSID)
The objectives of the first assignment are making practice using Task Space Inverse Dynamics (TSID) to make a humanoid robot walk and understanding the role of the task weights in order to tune them.
The pdf [report](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/blob/main/Report_assignment_01.pdf) contains the entire project procedure and all the considerations related to it, while in this [folder](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/tree/main/Assignment_01_TSID) there is all the Python code developed to simulate the humanoid robot walk.

## Second assignment (DDP)
The goals of the second assignment are using Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for generating trajectories and feedback control gains, then comparing two different methods for considering underactuation in DDP applied to the case of a double pendulum without motor on the second joint. All the considerations are reported in [this](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/blob/main/Report_assignment_02.pdf) report, while all the code related to this assignment is in this [folder](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/tree/main/Assignment_02_DDP).

## Third assignment (DQN)
In this project is required to implement the algorithm Deep Q-Network (DQN) and use it to find the optimal control policy for a single and a double pendulum swing-up problem. The double pendulum has only one actuated joint. The theoretical part and all the plots are reported in this [report](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/blob/main/Report_assignment_03.pdf), while the code is in this [folder](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/tree/main/Assignment_03_DQN).
