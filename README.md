# Optimization-based robot control project

## First assignment
The objectives of the first assignment are making practice using Task Space Inverse Dynamics (TSID) to make a humanoid robot walk and understanding the role of the task weights in order to tune them.
The pdf [report](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/blob/main/Report_assignment_01.pdf) contains the entire project procedure and all the considerations related to it, while in this [folder](https://github.com/mattiapettene/orc-project/tree/main/Assignment_01) there is all the Python code developed to simulate the humanoid robot walk.
